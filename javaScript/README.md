#Dear JavaScript!
It's 2016 and there is lots of different javaScript development. I will add all my javaScript work here. I worked with web development from 2009. Things are getting more advanced and complicated! Currently I am working with plain JavaScript, Angular.JS (https://angularjs.org/), React.JS (https://facebook.github.io/react/). I used to use jQuery and I still love it! For unit testing I am using Jasmin (http://jasmine.github.io/).
