#Dear JavaScript!
It's 2016 and there is lots of different javaScript development. I will add all my javaScript work here. I started working with web development from 2009. Things are getting more advanced and complicated! Currently I am working with plain JavaScript, Angular.JS (https://angularjs.org/), React.JS (https://facebook.github.io/react/) and of course NodeJs(https://nodejs.org/en/). I used to use jQuery and I still love it! For unit testing I am using Jasmin (http://jasmine.github.io/). 

why I use or like javaScript?
- The cool thing about javaScript is live data update without refreshing the web page. I know we can do more cool stuff. But I like this option most.

I am using RaspberryPi as development server. When I am satisfied with my project, pushing to github and uploading to target website. Each folder should contain readme.md for more details about the project. I want to explore more about javaScript.
